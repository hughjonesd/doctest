# Add a line of code to the test

`@testRaw` adds an arbitrary line of code to your test, without
including it in the .Rd example.

## Details

`@testRaw` adds an arbitrary line of code to your test:

    #' @doctest
    #' @testRaw skip_on_cran("Takes too long")
    #' @expect equal(6765)
    #' fibonacci(20)

Unless your doctest has at least one
[@expect](https://hughjonesd.github.io/doctest/reference/expect-tag.md)
or
[@expectRaw](https://hughjonesd.github.io/doctest/reference/expectRaw-tag.md)
tag, no test will be created. So use those tags, not `@testRaw`, to add
expectations.

Remember that the main purpose of examples is to document your package
for your users. If your code is getting too different from your example,
consider splitting it off into a proper test file. To do this, rename
the file in `tests/testthat`, and deleting the `Generated by doctest`
comment.
