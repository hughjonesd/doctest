# Exclude example code from a test

`@omit` excludes example code from a test until the next tag. Use
`@resume` to restart including code without creating an expectation.

## Details

Use `@omit` to avoid redundant or noisy code:

    #' @doctest
    #'
    #' @expect equal(0)
    #' sin(0)
    #'
    #' @omit
    #' curve(sin(x), 0, 2 * pi)
    #'
    #' @expect equal(1)
    #' cos(0)

`@omit` is separate from `\donttest` and `\dontrun` tags in Rd files.
This allows you to test code that would cause an error if run by R CMD
CHECK. If you also want R CMD CHECK to skip your code, you should use
`\donttest{}` separately (see [writing R
extensions](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Writing-R-documentation-files)).

Remember that the main purpose of examples is to document your package
for your users. If your code is getting too different from your example,
consider splitting it off into a proper test file. You can do this by
renaming it and deleting the `Generated by doctest` comment.
