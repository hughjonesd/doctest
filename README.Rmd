# testygen


<!-- badges: start -->

Testygen helps you to add "doctests" - tests combined with documentation - 
to your R package. You do this by adding tags to your roxygen examples.


## Installation

You can install the development version of testygen like so:

``` r
devtools::install("hughjonesd/testygen")
```

## Example

Here's some documentation for a function:

```r
```{r child = "tests/testthat/safe-mean.Rmd"}
```
```

This will create tests like:

```{r, echo = FALSE}

```

To use testygen, add the following line to your package DESCRIPTION:

```
Roxygen: list(roclets = c("collate", "rd", "namespace", "doctest")) 
```
